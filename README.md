To start the server, just run IRSE.exe ( make sure the files and folder above exist with IRSE.exe)

# Console Commands
commands start with / (IR's Command system is used when the server is running)

     
     /help - lists these commands
     /opengui - reopens the GUI if it was closed
     /start - starts the server
     /stop - stops the server
     /save - forces a universe save

Once the server is running these commands are added to IR's own command system.
