# FEATURES
     You can edit the server.json(Dedicated Server config) in the GUI
     Console commands to use (See the Console Command section below)
     You can read the chat from all players that talk on the console, or on the Chat tab of the GUI.
     You can build and use plugins.
     Custom console/chat commands. (IR Console/Chat commands work when server is running)

# INSTALLING

Just extract these files and the folder "IRSE" from the zip archive into your Interstellar Rift installation folder.

     IRSE Folder
     IRSE.exe
     IRSE.exe.config  
     
               

To start the server, just run IRSE.exe ( make sure the files and folder above exist with IRSE.exe)

# Console Commands
commands start with / (IR's Command system is used when the server is running)

     
     opengui - reopens the GUI if it was closed
     restart - restart IRSE.
     checkupdate - check for IRSE updates
     forceupdate - Force the installation of new IRSE, bypassing prompts.
     start - starts the server

Once the server is running these commands are added to IR's own command system.

There are a few ways to help! 

There is a patreon listed above that would give me more time to work on this program, as I have to do gig jobs which take up time from this to pay my bills.

You can contribute code by forking the repository and making some pull requests!

You can even help [translate the app into your local language!](TRANSLATIONS.md) Check it out!
