HES Server Name : ! {XTT}[US-Little Rock] [HellionExtendedServer] Hellion Service Development
Always runs the latest extender!

Hey all, I'm currently working on a dedicated server enhancer for Hellion Dedicated!


<i class="Italic">Hellion Extended Server uses reflection to enhance Hellions Dedicated Server by adding in a GUI (TODO) for control of game objects within Hellion in real time and adding server side chat for communicating with people playing on your server, it will include; </i>
<br>
<h2>Current Features</h2>
<ul>
<li> Send and receive chat from the console window
<li> On Demand Saving
<li> Log player spawns ( no disconnects as of yet )
<li> 
</ul>
<br>
<pre class="CodeBlock">
Console Commands ( commands start with /)

     /players - returns the amount of players on the server
     /help - will have actual help soon!
     /save - forces a save
</pre>

It's very minimalistic right now, but in future updates  it will have a GUI, a plugin system, and much more!
