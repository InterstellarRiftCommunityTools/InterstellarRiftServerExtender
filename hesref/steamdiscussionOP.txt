[h1] Downloads[/h1]

You can find the latest releases on our jenkins of the master branch, dev branch, and the experimental branch. These are updated everytime we make a change to the repository, but soon it will only do it on certian style commits so we're not sending updates to hes out every 5 minutes.

These will be used for the update feature on HES, and you'll be able to choose which branch you would like to use from within hes. 

We'll always try to keep master stable! Dev will always get the changes before Master, and Experimental will be used for the crazy stuff!

Remember to always backup your server before using HES!
